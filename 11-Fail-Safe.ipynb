    "This notebook delves into fail-safe mechanisms within Snowflake, focusing on storage usage at both account and table levels. The initial queries provide a detailed account of storage metrics, including STORAGE, STAGE, and FAILSAFE usage, presented in a user-friendly format.\n",
    "\n",
    "The subsequent analyses zoom in on table-level storage usage, emphasizing key metrics like ACTIVE_BYTES, TIME_TRAVEL_BYTES, and FAILSAFE_BYTES. These metrics offer insights into the storage consumed by active data, historical versions, and fail-safe storage, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding and monitoring storage consumption at these levels is crucial for implementing effective fail-safe strategies and ensuring the reliability of data in Snowflake."
