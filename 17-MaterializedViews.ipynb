    "### In this chapter, the functionality of Materialized Views in Snowflake was explored. The chapter commenced by disabling global caching to ensure a fair test environment. A table was prepared in the TPCH_SF100 schema, and a sample statement view was demonstrated. Subsequently, a Materialized View named ORDERS_MV was created to aggregate data. The chapter delved into querying and updating data, showcasing the impact on both the original and materialized views. To demonstrate efficiency, caching was re-enabled for comparison. The use of Materialized Views in Snowflake proves beneficial for optimizing query performance by pre-aggregating and storing results.\n"
