    "# Chapter 18: Data Masking in Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter focuses on implementing data masking policies in Snowflake, a crucial aspect of securing sensitive information. The process involves defining masking policies and applying them selectively based on roles. The key steps and examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Setting Up**\n",
    "   - Table Preparation: Creating the CUSTOMERS table with various columns, including phone and email.\n",
    "   - Role Definition: Establishing roles (ANALYST_MASKED and ANALYST_FULL) to control access levels.\n",
    "   - Role Permissions: Granting select permissions on the CUSTOMERS table and usage permissions on the schema and warehouse.\n",
    "   - Role Assignment: Assigning roles to a user (NIKOLAISCHULER) to demonstrate role-based access control.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Masking Policy Creation**\n",
    "   - Basic Policy: Creating a masking policy named 'phone' to mask phone numbers for users without full access.\n",
    "   - Policy Application: Applying the masking policy specifically to the phone column in the CUSTOMERS table.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Validation of Policies**\n",
    "   - Role Switching: Querying data under different roles (ANALYST_FULL and ANALYST_MASKED) to showcase the dynamic application of masking policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Unsetting and Replacing Policies**\n",
    "   - Examples:\n",
    "     - Multiple Columns: Applying policies to multiple columns (full_name and phone).\n",
    "     - Replace/Drop: Dropping and replacing the phone policy with a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Altering Existing Policies**\n",
    "   - Policy Alteration: Modifying the phone policy to use a different masking logic.\n",
    "   - Unsetting Policy: Unsetting the masking policy for the email column.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Real-Life Examples**\n",
    "   - Example 1: Creating a masking policy named 'emails' to mask email addresses, keeping the domain visible for certain roles.\n",
    "   - Example 2: Creating a masking policy named 'sha2' to hash the full_name column, enhancing data security.\n",
    "   - Example 3: Creating a masking policy named 'dates' to mask date information, replacing it with a default date for non-full access roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter provides a comprehensive understanding of data masking in Snowflake, covering policy creation, application, validation, alteration, and real-life scenarios. Implementing these practices ensures that sensitive data remains protected while allowing controlled access based on user roles.\n"
